Use of EE in development and test environments is free. EE requires a paid subscription for production use. Our paid annual subscriptions for EE include a commercial license, better availability capabilities, enhanced security features, advanced tooling and higher performance and scale. It also includes technical support with service level commitments via our 24x7 support organization and hot fixes for releases. One important principle for CE and EE is to ensure full portability of applications between two editions. The capabilities ensure that an application running on EE should simply transition to CE without code changes and visa versa.",

The only thing which cannot be encrypted without breaking your\ncloud synchronization is the modification date of your files.\n\nCryptomator is a free and open source software licensed under the GPLv3. This allows anyone to check our code. It\nis impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties. Also we cannot hide vulnerabilities. And the best thing\nis: There is no need to trust us, as you can control us!\n\nVendor lock-ins are impossible. Even if we decided to stop development: The source code is already cloned by\nhundreds of other developers. As you don't need an account, you will never stand in front of locked doors.\n\nCryptomator is provided free of charge as an open-source project despite the high development effort and is therefore dependent on donations.\n",

		"Description": "The Diskuv OCaml distribution is an open-source set of software that supports\nsoftware development in pure OCaml. The distribution's strengths are its:\n\n✓ full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind\n✓ laser focus on \"native\" development (desktop software, mobile apps and\n  embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like\n  Visual Studio and Xcode\n✓ ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands;\n  high school students should be able to use it\n✓ security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds\n\nThe installation will take approximately 1.5 HOURS on a modern Windows PC.\n\nThis version does not currently work if you have a space in your username\n(ex. C:\\Users\\Jane Smith).\n\nInstalling this package will automatically install the required prerequisites\nfor Windows development:\n* Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 (it will not touch any existing Visual Studio\n  installation)\n* Git for Windows (if and only if your machine does not have it installed)\n\nThese alternatives may be better depending on your use case:\n\n* Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at Esy and Reason\n* Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at Mirage OS\n* Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old OCaml on\n  Debian, etc. works well\n* Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well\n* Wanting quick installations? Use anything but Diskuv OCaml! Diskuv OCaml\n  will conduct from-source builds unless it can guarantee (and code sign) the\n  binaries are reproducible. Today that means a lot of compiling.\n\nCommercial tools and support are available from Diskuv for mixed OCaml/C\ndevelopment; however, this pure OCaml winget package only has limited support\nfor mixed OCaml/C. For example, the \"ctypes\" opam package has been patched\nto work with Visual Studio but is out-dated. Contact\nsupport AT diskuv.com if you need OCaml/C development.",

SODA for SPARC is designed such that users can accomplish all the requirements to submit a SPARC dataset rapidly through a single interface. Moreover, requirements have been broken down into easy-to-perform steps and automation has been integrated to reduce users' effort to a bare minimum during each step, often to just a few clicks.",

		"Description": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience.\nThis project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and use them.\nThis package contains only the native part of the FirefoxPWA project. You should also install the browser extension if you haven't already. You can download it from <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/>.",

Files can be copied to and from a mounted VeraCrypt volume just like they are copied to/from any normal disk (for example, by simple\ndrag-and-drop operations). Files are automatically being decrypted on the fly (in memory/RAM) while they are being read or copied from an encrypted VeraCrypt volume.\nSimilarly, files that are being written or copied to the VeraCrypt volume are automatically being encrypted on the fly (right before they are written to the disk) in RAM.\nNote that this does not mean that the whole file that is to be encrypted/decrypted must be stored in RAM before it can be encrypted/decrypted.

Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more. Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.",

It provides you with nonlinear fits of arbitrary functions as well as a ODE solver. It can display 1D and 2D data easily and publication-ready with a simple command. Fourier transforms are included as well as wavelet transforms. Data is managed in a table-based manner and automatically saved, so you can quickly resume after a restart. SIMPLE TASKS ARE SIMPLE - We never understood why you have to write as much code for simple things as for more complex tasks. Our mantra is therefore Keep simple things simple. SYNTAX AS INTUITIVE AS A LANGUAGE - The main goal is to be as intuitive as possible, which implies a syntax that is as simple and clear as possible. NumeRe does not try to be dynamically typed, but deliberately emphasizes that you understand what is happening as soon as you read the code. In addition, the advanced editor highlights different data structures in different colors, so the syntax may seem a bit \"colorful and choppy\" at first. But we can guarantee that you will appreciate it very soon. STRUCTURE BUILT IN - When writing procedures, the deeply-integrated namespaces help you to keep order right away, because each folder automatically corresponds to a namespace. This makes it possible to have several procedures with the same name that are still unique. The editor supports you by auto-completion, as well as by displaying tooltips that show documentation and signatures of functions, commands and procedures.",

ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games' executables and is not an emulator. It supports a huge library of adventures with over 325 games in total. It supports many classics published by legendary studios like LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and Westwood Studios. Next to ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series, Broken Sword, Myst, Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some really obscure adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.",

Using 010 Memorizer, you can convert a number into a word or phrase that forms an image in your mind. The conversion between numbers and words is done by phonetics: certain consonant sounds represent certain numbers and vowels act as fillers. 010 Memorizer helps you with this conversion by listing all words that can be used to memorize a number, and you just have to pick a word or phrase that you find easy to remember.",

As well, other calculations such as SWR, reactance, resonant frequency, inductance of an air core coil, and antenna impedance are supported. One of the more powerful features of Hamic is to solve for almost any unknown variable in a circuit; Hamic can even solve L networks without having to use Smith charts. Also, Hamic can easily convert between a number of different units. Once you have finished your work, your calculations can be saved to a worksheet and retrieved later. People interested in working with circuits or antennas should check this program out!",
